# Hive Bounties – A Decentralized Bug Bounty Platform on Hive 🐝

## Team Introduction

We are passionate about creating decentralized solutions that bridge the gap between developers and project maintainers. Our focus is on building transparent, efficient, and user-friendly platforms that leverage the power of blockchain technology.

## Project Overview – Hive Bounties

### 🎯 Problem
Traditional bug bounty platforms face several challenges:
- High platform fees eating into rewards
- Delayed payments to developers
- Lack of transparency in bounty allocation
- Complex verification processes
- Limited payment options

### 💡 Solution
Hive Bounties is a decentralized bug bounty platform that connects project maintainers with developers using the Hive blockchain. It enables direct, transparent, and immediate rewards for bug fixes and feature implementations.

### ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Wallet Integration**
   - Seamless connection through Hive Keychain
   - Secure, password-less authentication
   - Real-time balance tracking

2. **Bounty Creation**
   - Direct link to GitHub issues/PRs
   - Flexible reward amounts in HIVE/HBD
   - Optional deadline setting
   - Clear description and requirements

3. **Bounty Management**
   - Real-time status tracking
   - Transparent reward distribution
   - Automated payment on completion
   - Direct communication between parties

4. **Smart Contract Integration**
   - Secure escrow system
   - Automated payment distribution
   - Transparent transaction history
